### 1. Yoda – the cat with four ears
Chicago, Illinois, couple Valerie and Ted Rock took the cat in two years ago after they visited a local bar, where a group of drinkers were handing the animal around and making fun of him.

Since being adopted by the Rocks and after getting his picture posted on the Internet, the two-year-old feline has become an international media celebrity.

The Rocks have received calls from Good Morning America, Fox News and The Tyra Banks Show. The moggy’s mugshot has graced the pages of the London Guardian and British tabloids.

Despite his strange appearance, Yoda – named after the pointy-eared Star Wars character (pictured below) – is a perfectly normal and affectionate cat and a delight to have around.

His extra ears are thought to be the result of a genetic mutation.

But Yoda’s owners are keeping a close watch on their much-loved pet. They are concerned he could be catnapped because he is so different.


### ###  Salt coffee – Last Part

After 40 years, he passed away, and left her a letter which said: 

“My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my life’s lie. 

This was the only lie I said to you – the salty coffee. 

Remember the first time we dated?

I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt, it was hard for me to change so I just went ahead. 

I never thought that would be the start of my biggest lie. 

I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to, as I had promised never to lie to you. 

Now I’m dying, and afraid of nothing so I will tell you the truth: I don’t like salty coffee, what a strange bad taste!

But I have had salty coffee for my whole life.

Since I have known you, I have never felt sorry for anything I have done for you. 

Having you with me is the biggest happiness of my life.

If I could live again, I would want to know you and have you for my whole life, even if I had to drink the salty coffee again.”

Her tears made the letter totally wet.

Some day, someone asked her: “How does salty coffee taste?” “It’s sweet,” she replied. 

### 3. Salt coffee

He met her at a party.

She was so outstanding, many guys were chasing after her, while he was so normal, nobody paid attention to him.

At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee with him.

She was so surprised, but due to being polite, she promised.

They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything, she felt uncomfortable, and she thought, “Please, let me go home.”

Suddenly he asked the waiter:

“Would you please give me some salt? I’d like to put it in my coffee.”

Everybody stared at him, so strange!

His face turned red, but still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it.

She asked him curiously:

“Why do you have this hobby?”

He replied:

“When I was a little boy I lived near the sea, I liked playing in the sea; I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of this salty coffee.

Now every time I have salty coffee, I always think of my childhood, think of my hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents who are still living there.”

### 4. Dating

One day in the 1920’s, a young man asked if he could visit a woman at her home. When he arrived at her home, she was wearing a hat on her head. 

Many people today may not understand what this story means. But any American in the 1920’s would understand. The hat said that the girl would like to go out with him. 

In the past, men liked sitting in the girl’s house to talk, to meet her mother, to have something to eat and to listen to her play the piano. However women would like to go on a date, to go out somewhere interesting. 

This new style of dating began to take the place of the old system of visiting in society in the early 20th century. Nowadays, it is very popular around the world.

### 5. Reasons of love

When choosing a partner for life what do people usually think of? A recent study has shown that these following factors are the most important things that one takes into consideration when choosing his/her partner. Firstly, beauty is an important factor. 

Although many people say that the partner’s appearance is not important, research has shown that beauty has great effect. Secondly, money is also as important as appearance. 

Rich people are easier to attract the opposite sex than the poor. Both men and women say that they think much on how much money their partners have before they decide to get married. 

In addition, timing is important, if the partner comes in time, marriage is more possible. Do you see? If your partner comes when you are available or eager to love, he will be accepted easily.



### 6. Attractiveness in American culture

In a test done in the 1970s, 1,031 students at the University of Wyoming said what they considered attractive in their partners. Their answers were not new. 

Men tended to prefer blondes, blue eyes and light skin color, while women liked darker men. 

However, there were some surprises. Few men liked very large breasts or boyish women. Almost none of the women liked very muscular men. In fact, both men and women prefer the average. 

Too short, too tall, too pale or too dark were not chosen. Averageness still wins. In a recent study, scientists chose 94 faces of American women and used the computer to make a picture of an average face. 

Then they asked people which face they liked. Of the 94 real faces, only 4 faces were considered to be more attractive than the average face. Most people said that they preferred the average face. 

### 7. Love Map

Why do we fall in love with this one but not that? Why Bill instead of Ray? Researcher John Money believes that everyone has something he calls a “love map”. 

Long before you fall in love with someone, you have developed a map which shows with whom you will fall in love. 

When children meet friends, family members and other people, they will collect certain things that they like in these people. Gradually their memories begin to form an ideal lover in their mind. 

As they grow up, their love map becomes clearer. So long before you love someone, you already know some things about him. Then you will meet someone that has something similar to your ideal, and you fall in love with him. 

Actually this one is far different from your ideal. However you can not see these differences. That’s why a famous saying goes: “Love is blind”

### 8. This thing called love

A man and a woman are at a party. They are strangers. This is the first time they meet. The woman sees the man first. He is talking to some of his friends. “He has a nice smile”, she thinks. 

She moves to be in his vision and sees if he has noticed her. Actually the man is also looking at her. Their eyes meet for the first time. 

She begins talking to people near her, waiting for him to come to talk with her. And he does. They find a peaceful place to sit and talk to each other. 

They talk so much. They talk as if no one else is in the room. Each tries to tell the other everything. Both know that they have fallen in love. 


### 9. Independence Day

Before the end of the 1700s, the United States did not exist. It was only 13 colonies on the continent of North America which were under the control of King George III of Britain. 

The colonies found that it was difficult to be under the control of a king who was too far away from them. They wanted to be free. They wanted to set up their own government. 

A war started. After years of fighting, on July 2, 1776 the Declaration of Independence for the 13 colonies was written. 

However Independence Day is now celebrated on July 4, because that is the day the Declaration of Independence was officially adopted. 

The 13 colonies of North America were then free from the control of the British King. However the war did not end in 1776. It was still on till 1783. In 1783 Independence Day became an official holiday in the United States.


### 10. My dogs

Pets are domesticated animals that we keep for pleasure. Of all the pets I like dog the most. In my house we have two dogs. One is an Alsatian dog and the other is a bulldog. 

The Alsatian was bought locally by my mother and the bulldog was given to us by a European family. We call the Alsatian ‘Jimmie’ and the bulldog ‘Jonnie’. The dogs respond well whenever I call them by their names. 

The Alsatian is kept mainly for watching our house especially at night. It barks loudly whenever there is a noise around our house. My favorite is the bulldog Jonnie. 

It is a funny looking breed and rare in the world. I feed him bones, meat and dog-biscuits. 

I bath him everyday to keep him clean. It follows me wherever I go. It knows the time I usually return from school and will wait at the gate to welcome me home.

### 13. A message to a new friend

Hi Lucia 

How are you? It was so nice to meet you last week in Sydney at the sales meeting. How was the rest of your trip? Did you see any kangaroos? I hope you got home to Mexico City OK. 

Anyway, I have the documents about the new Berlin offices. We're going to be open in three months. I moved here from London just last week. They are very nice offices, and the location is perfect. There are lots of restaurants, cafés and banks in the area. There's also public transport; we are next to an U-Bahn (that is the name for the metro here). Maybe you can come and see them one day? I would love to show you Berlin, especially in the winter. You said you have never seen snow – you will see lots here! Here's a photo of you and me at the restaurant in Sydney. That was a very fun night! Remember the singing Englishman? Crazy! Please send me any other photos you have of that night. Good memories. 

Please give me your email address and I will send you the documents. 

Bye for now 

Mikel

### 14. An email from a friend

Hi Samia, 

Just a quick email to say that sounds like a great idea. Saturday is better for me because I'm meeting my parents on Sunday. So if that's still good for you, why don't you come here? Then you can see the new flat and all the work we've done on the kitchen since we moved in. We can eat at home and then go for a walk in the afternoon. It's going to be so good to catch up finally. I want to hear all about your new job! Our address is 52 Charles Road, but it's a bit difficult to find because the house numbers are really strange here. If you turn left at the post office and keep going past the big white house on Charles Road, there's a small side street behind it with the houses 50–56 in. Don't ask me why the side street doesn't have a different name! But call me if you get lost and I'll come and get you.   

Let me know if there's anything you do/don't like to eat. 

Really looking forward to seeing you! See you soon! 

Gregor
